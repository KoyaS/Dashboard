# Flutter Dashboard
 A standalone dashboard which shows your day at a glance. This program will be running 24/7 on a monitor and works similar to how smart mirrors have been implemented.

With a modular design, different elements of the dashboard can be added/removed and users can log in through a google account to access personalized features.
